As the fourth Matrix film makes its way into the cinemas, dividing audience members between the utterly disappointed and the satisfied nostalgics, a new development in the world of big tech is slowly settling in,silencing on its way the sarcastic laughs at Mark Zuckerberg's awkward Metaverse introduction video.

There seems to be little consensus so far as to what the meaverse actually is and whether it indeed brings us closer to the imagined distopian future the Matrix films portray. 
Critics of this not-so-distant future of humanity would argue that big tech have harvested our attention long enough and are now ready for the next big step. We already are incessantly hooked to the digital world and even though a physical barrier will always exist, we are living orgnaisms after all, this barrier is about to get even thinner. 

The idea is to assemble the distributed pieces of our digital existance into one all-incompassing virtual world mirroring all aspects of the physical one. Of course there might still be multiple virtual worlds provided by different competing companies - Microsoft's latest aquisition of Blizzard is seen as an attempt to buy expertise in gamer engagement in order to rival Facebook's Metaverse plans - but the results will likely be the same. In this new imagined future, we will be wearing VR headsets from the time we wake up until we go to sleep with breaks in between to tend to our biological needs. The metaverse will be where we work, travel, entertain ourselves and consume digital goods. If the digital garments already being envisioned by luxury brands are any indication, the social hierarchy of the physical world will most likely be ported to the metaverse, if not amplified. Adding to that the ease with which providers of the metaverse can track every aspect of our existance within it.
