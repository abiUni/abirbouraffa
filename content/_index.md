Hi, I'm Abir!

I am a Ph.D. student in empirical software engineering at the university of Hamburg, Germany. My main research area is program comprehension and knowledge communication in software engineering workflows. I am curious about cognitive processes involved in understanding source code and how software developers can contribute to a more sustainable future. I am also very interested in economics and how new generations are devising new approaches to cope with the legacy of the current economic climate.

Please feel free to get in touch (üó£Ô∏è ENG/DE/FR/AR)!
