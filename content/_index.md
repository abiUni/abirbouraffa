Hi, I'm Abir!

I am a Ph.D. student in empirical software engineering at the university of Hamburg, Germany. My main research area is program comprehension and knowledge communication in software engineering workflow. I am curious about cognitive processes involved in understanding source code and how software developers can contribute to a more sustainable future, not necessarily in that order.

Please feel free to get in touch (üó£Ô∏è ENG/DE/FR/AR)!
